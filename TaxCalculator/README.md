### Project Description:
In this assignment, we used conditional statements, reused codes with functions to create more variables, and stored values in an array. This was all practiced on a tax calculator with an accurate tax rate calculation based on income with a submit button and a clear button to reset the entire page's contents.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We used if/else statements to make a specific action occur if something specific was chosen. For this lesson, we used if/else statements with tax rates and income; there was the original 'set' of the minimum income that was the 'if' statement, and then if a person makes a certain amount of money and also files in a specific way, then else/if allows the calculator to use the original 'if' statement and use it for other incomes to calculate more functions.
2. Function statements make things happen in the JavaScript code. There are three ways to handle the events: specify the function as value for the HTML attribute, specify the function as a property value for an object, or use the addEventListener() method.
3. Variable scope is where in the code a declared variable is available for use. A global variable is declared outside a function, while a local variable is declared inside a function. It's best to use 'var' when declaring a variable because it lets anyone looking at the code know when and where the declaration will be used. If 'var' is not used, then it automatically becomes a global variable. 

• Global variable
– Declared outside a function
• Available to all parts of code
• Local variable
– Declared inside a function
• Only available within the function in which it is declared
– Cease to exist when the function ends
– Keyword var required
